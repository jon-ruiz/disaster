 ### Project Description
---
During a major disaster, it is essential to provide the public and responders with relevant local news updates in order to gain situational awareness during the event. During a disaster, news updates are coming from tens to hundreds of different sources, all in different formats, available from different websites, news channels etc., and it is often difficult to find what would be most helpful amid the chaos of other non-disaster related news and media. There is currently no forum for rounding up and archiving relevant news for a live disaster event. This project will leverage news feeds relevant to specific disasters, gathered from multiple sources, to create a webpage that presents these live feeds in one dashboard.

Flask and HTML will be used to create the dashboard. Dashboard will include live severe weather alerts and recent disaster declarations on the national level. Severe weather alerts will be shown by "Location" and "Type" of warning, with provided links to related news searches. Recent disaster declarations will be shown by "State," "Type," and "Dates," with provided links to related news searches.
